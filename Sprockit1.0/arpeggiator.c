/*
@brief This function generates the arpeggiator pattern. It is called by the main routine if
the arpeggiator function is activated. It has multiple modes.

@param It takes the global setting structure as input. The global setting structure contains tells the
arpeggiator which mode to be in.

@return It doesn't return anything. It sets the active note and sets various flags depending on which mode
it's in.

The MIDI routine has to check to see if the arpeggiator is turned on. 

The arpeggiator will have the following parameters:
p_global_setting->auc_synth_params[ARPEGGIATOR_MODE] - This is the main mode parameter. 0 is off.
p_global_setting->auc_synth_params[ARPEGGIATOR_SPEED] - This is how fast the arpeggiator will play back.
p_global_setting->auc_synth_params[ARPEGGIATOR_LENGTH] - This is how many notes will be played.
p_global_setting->auc_synth_params[ARPEGGIATOR_GATE] - This how much of the note period is note on.

The stored arpeggiator patterns will have for each step:
a transposition - how many half-steps up or down from the original is the note


How it's gonna work - 
We have to keep track of notes held and the sequence they were hit in. The arpeggiator cycles through this 
sequence of notes performing the necessary transpositions. Once it reaches the end of the sequence, it repeats.
