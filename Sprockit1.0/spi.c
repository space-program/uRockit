@brief This module contains functions for transmitting and receiving information over the
SPI bus. Initially, I used a bunch of i/o expanders but I ended up cutting down to just one.
Still, we have to ask that I/O expander what button was pressed when one is, and we have to send
data packets to the digital pots in the filter to let it know what frequency and how much resonance.
