@function: calculate_pitch

@brief: The purpose of this function is to calculate the pitch of the oscillators.  This can be as straightforward
as taking the MIDI note number received from the MIDI process and looking up the frequency in the look-up table.
It can get a little more complicated as well.  Complications can come from two sources: MIDI pitch bends, and
the LFO.  Early versions of this code just skipped from one note frequency to the next.  The result is steps in 
the frequency rather than a smooth pitch bend.  Later versions remedied this problem with a bit of math.
