@brief This module contains the adsr (attack, decay, sustain, release) amplitude envelope generator.
The routine is based on a timer that controls how long it takes to get from 
one phase of the envelope to the next.  It's nothing fancy, just set the timer, wait for the
timer to run out and increment the multiplier.  Once it gets to the target value, it moves to the
next stage. Sustain just holds the value as long as the note is being played.

@brief The adsr function calculates the amplitude envelope for the ADSR function. It's 
based around a central timer which is counting down. The number of countdown cycles
determines how long each stage of the envelope takes. 
There are different ways to handle the ADSR. This method does not start from zero with 
every new note. It's hard with an analog ADSR to avoid pops and clicks with sudden large
changes in amplitude. You're free to try to fix that problem.

@param It takes the global setting structure.

@return It returns nothing, just setting the adsr multiplier variable in the global structure.
