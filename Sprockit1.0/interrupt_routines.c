@brief This interrupt service routine handles Timer 2 - 8 bit timer compare match interrupts.
This interrupt sets a flag which is checked in the main routine.  Setting this flag tells the main
process to handle one of the auxiliary tasks.

routine, it loads the buffer and points the pointer to the right member for either two or three byte
transmission.  We know the transmission is complete when the point points to a null value which is the
end of the buffer.
